# Playbooks by Stage

Each playbook targets a specific GTM stage and company archetype. They are opinionated — designed to be adapted, not followed blindly.

---

## Early Stage (0 → 1 GTM)

### Playbook 1: SEO-Driven Founder-Led Narrative

**Stage:** Early (pre-seed to seed, 0-10 employees)

**Goal:** Establish organic search presence around the founder's unique market insight, generating the first pipeline of ICP-fit leads from search.

**Scenario:** A technical founder has built a developer tool. There is no marketing team. The founder writes well and has strong opinions about the problem space, but has zero organic traffic.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the founder's 3 strongest opinions** about the market, the problem, or how existing solutions fail. These become the narrative pillars.
2. **Map each opinion to a search query cluster.** Use AI to find queries where the founder's perspective is a direct answer to what people search for.
3. **Write 5 long-form "thesis" posts.** Each post takes a strong position, provides evidence, and naturally connects to the product. The founder's voice is the differentiator — AI can draft, but the founder must edit for authenticity.
4. **Optimize each post for SEO.** Target keywords, proper headings, meta tags, internal links to the product page.
5. **Add a simple conversion path.** Email signup for a "founder's newsletter" on TOFU posts. Free trial CTA on BOFU posts.
6. **Publish one post per week for 5 weeks.** Distribute each via the founder's personal LinkedIn and any relevant communities.
7. **Track impressions, clicks, and signups weekly.** Adjust topics based on what gains traction.
8. **After 5 posts, assess and plan the next batch.** Double down on the topic cluster that generated the most qualified interest.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Writing about what the founder finds interesting rather than what the ICP searches for.
- Over-polishing with AI to the point where the founder's voice disappears.
- Skipping the conversion path ("we'll add CTAs later").
- Not tracking results, so you can't tell what's working.

### Playbook 2: AIO-Powered Content Sprint

**Stage:** Early (seed to Series A, small team)

**Goal:** Publish 20-30 SEO-optimized pages in 30 days using AI-assisted content production, establishing initial search coverage for the product's primary keyword universe.

**Scenario:** A SaaS startup has just hired their first marketer. The product has clear use cases, but the website has only a homepage and a pricing page. There is no blog, no resource center, and no organic traffic.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the keyword universe.** Use AI + a keyword tool to generate 100-200 keywords related to the product's use cases. Cluster into 15-20 topic groups.
2. **Prioritize 20-30 topics.** Select based on buying intent and keyword difficulty. Aim for a mix of TOFU (60%), MOFU (25%), and BOFU (15%).
3. **Set up the AIO pipeline.**
   - Day 1-2: Generate all content briefs using AI.
   - Day 3-15: Draft all posts using AI. Allocate 30 minutes of human editing per post for accuracy and voice.
   - Day 16-20: Optimize all posts (SEO scoring, internal linking, meta tags).
   - Day 21-25: Add CTAs and conversion tracking to each post.
   - Day 26-30: Publish, submit to Search Console, distribute on one social channel each.
4. **Build a content hub structure.** Create 3-4 pillar pages that link to cluster posts. This signals topical authority to search engines.
5. **Set up a simple analytics dashboard.** Track: pages indexed → impressions → clicks → sessions → signups.
6. **Review at day 45 and day 90.** Identify which clusters are gaining traction. Plan the next sprint around winners.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Prioritizing volume over quality. Even AI-drafted content needs human review for accuracy.
- Targeting keywords that are too competitive for a new domain. Focus on long-tail and low-difficulty terms first.
- Publishing without any internal linking. Orphaned pages struggle to rank.
- Not setting up conversion tracking before publishing. You can't measure ROI without it.

## Growth Stage (1 → N)

### Playbook 3: Content-to-Pipeline Attribution Engine

**Stage:** Growth (Series A to B, 20-100 employees)

**Goal:** Build a measurable system that connects content investment to pipeline and revenue, enabling the GTM team to prove and optimize content ROI.

**Scenario:** A growth-stage B2B SaaS company publishes content regularly and generates organic traffic, but cannot prove how content contributes to pipeline. Marketing leadership needs data to justify headcount and budget.

**Steps:**

1. **Instrument the full funnel.** Ensure tracking exists from first touch (organic search click) through to closed deal. Tools: Google Analytics → CRM → revenue reporting.
2. **Define attribution model.** Start simple: first-touch attribution for organic content. Track which content page was the first interaction for each lead that enters the pipeline.
3. **Tag all content with funnel stage and topic cluster** in the CMS or a spreadsheet. This enables performance analysis by segment.
4. **Build a monthly content performance report.** For each content piece, track: organic sessions, leads generated, pipeline influenced, and revenue attributed.
5. **Identify content archetypes that drive pipeline.** Is it comparison pages? Technical tutorials? Use case pages? Invest more in the archetypes that perform.
6. **Deprecate or consolidate underperforming content.** If a page has been live for 6+ months with zero pipeline contribution, redirect or rewrite it.
7. **Use pipeline data to inform the content calendar.** The editorial calendar should be driven by "what topics generate pipeline," not "what topics seem interesting."
8. **Report to leadership quarterly.** Show: content investment (cost), content output (volume), content pipeline (revenue). Calculate content-sourced CAC.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Over-complicating attribution before you have enough data. Start with first-touch; add multi-touch later.
- Only measuring traffic instead of pipeline. High-traffic, zero-pipeline content is a cost center.
- Not aligning with sales on what counts as "content-influenced." Define this with RevOps upfront.
- Reporting on vanity metrics (pageviews, time on page) instead of business metrics (leads, pipeline, revenue).

### Playbook 4: PLG + SEO Flywheel

**Stage:** Growth (product-led growth company with self-serve)

**Goal:** Create a self-reinforcing loop where SEO drives signups, product usage generates content signals, and content signals improve SEO.

**Scenario:** A PLG company has a freemium product with 10K+ monthly active users. The marketing site drives signups via organic search, but the connection between product usage and content strategy is ad hoc.

**Steps:**

1. **Map the product's "aha moments"** — the actions that correlate with retention and conversion. These become the activation targets.
2. **Create SEO content that leads directly to aha moments.** Example: "How to [do X with Y tool]" → lands on a tutorial → CTA is "Try it now" → user lands in-product at the exact feature.
3. **Build template and example galleries** that are SEO-indexable. If your product creates outputs (reports, designs, dashboards), showcase public examples that rank for relevant queries.
4. **Instrument the signup-to-aha funnel.** Track: organic visit → signup → aha moment → paid conversion. Segment by landing page.
5. **Optimize onboarding for organic traffic.** Organic visitors have specific intent based on the query they searched. Personalize onboarding based on the landing page that referred them.
6. **Create a user-generated content loop.** Encourage users to publish and share their outputs. These become backlinks and social signals that improve SEO.
7. **Measure and optimize weekly.** Track the flywheel: content → signups → activation → product usage → content signals → more content.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Building SEO content that drives signups but not activation. If users sign up and never reach the aha moment, SEO traffic is wasted.
- Ignoring the onboarding experience for organic visitors. They need a different path than users who come from ads or referrals.
- Not making the product experience indexable. If your best content is behind a login wall, search engines can't see it.

## Enterprise / Multi-Product

### Playbook 5: Multi-Product SEO Architecture

**Stage:** Enterprise (multiple product lines, large content footprint)

**Goal:** Design and maintain an SEO architecture that prevents cannibalization across product lines while maximizing total organic visibility.

**Scenario:** An enterprise software company has 3-5 product lines, each with its own landing pages, blog content, and documentation. Content teams for different products are publishing overlapping content that competes internally in search results.

**Steps:**

1. **Audit the current content footprint.** Crawl all product sites and blogs. Map every page to its target keyword and product line.
2. **Identify cannibalization.** Find cases where multiple pages from different product lines target the same keyword. Use Search Console to see which URL Google prefers.
3. **Define keyword ownership rules.** Create a keyword-to-product mapping. Each keyword cluster is "owned" by one product line. Shared terms (e.g., the company brand) get a dedicated cross-product page.
4. **Restructure content architecture.** Each product line gets its own content hub. Cross-product topics get a shared resource center. Implement canonical tags and internal linking to signal the primary page for each topic.
5. **Build a governance process.** Before any product team publishes new content, they check the keyword ownership map to avoid creating competing pages.
6. **Centralize SEO reporting.** Build a dashboard that shows organic visibility per product line and per keyword cluster. Track cannibalization metrics monthly.
7. **Use AI to monitor for drift.** Set up a quarterly AI-assisted audit that checks for new cannibalization and keyword ownership violations.
8. **Coordinate product launches.** When a new product or feature launches, integrate its content plan into the existing architecture from the start.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Letting each product team operate independently without SEO coordination. This guarantees cannibalization.
- Over-consolidating content. Not every overlapping keyword needs one page. Sometimes different product lines legitimately serve different intents for the same query.
- Building the architecture once and never maintaining it. SEO architecture requires ongoing governance.

### Playbook 6: RevOps + GEO Instrumentation Baseline

**Stage:** Enterprise (scaling revenue operations)

**Goal:** Build the foundational instrumentation that connects marketing, sales, and customer success data into a unified GEO measurement system.

**Scenario:** A Series C+ company has separate tools for marketing analytics, product analytics, CRM, and customer success. Data exists in silos. No one can answer "what is the true CAC of an organic-sourced customer?" or "what is the LTV difference between customers acquired via search vs. paid?"

**Steps:**

1. **Map the current data landscape.** Document every tool in the stack, what data it holds, and where the gaps are.
2. **Define the GEO metrics map** for your business. Customize the Acquisition → Activation → Revenue → Retention framework with your specific metrics and definitions.
3. **Implement identity resolution.** Use a CDP (e.g., Segment) or build a custom identity graph so that a single user can be tracked from anonymous website visit through to revenue.
4. **Instrument the handoff points.** The moments where data passes between systems (marketing → CRM, CRM → product analytics, product analytics → billing) are where data is most often lost. Validate each handoff.
5. **Build the baseline dashboard.** A single dashboard that shows the full funnel: impressions → sessions → leads → PQLs → SQLs → opportunities → closed revenue → NRR. Segmented by acquisition channel.
6. **Calculate channel-level unit economics.** For each acquisition channel (organic, paid, referral, outbound): CAC, payback period, LTV, and LTV/CAC ratio.
7. **Set up alerting for funnel anomalies.** If any stage-to-stage conversion rate drops by more than 20% week-over-week, trigger an alert.
8. **Train GTM leaders on the dashboard.** The instrumentation is only valuable if people use it. Run a session with marketing, sales, and CS leaders to walk through the dashboard and align on definitions.

**Risks / Anti-patterns:**

- Trying to build perfect attribution before building basic instrumentation. Get the data flowing first; refine the model later.
- Letting the BI team build the dashboard without GTM input. The dashboard should answer GTM questions, not just display data.
- Ignoring data quality. Bad data in the CRM (wrong sources, duplicate records, missing fields) will undermine the entire system.
- Building instrumentation but not establishing a regular cadence of reviewing the data. Schedule weekly and monthly reviews.
