# End-to-End GTM Workflows

Each workflow below spans all three pillars (SEO, AIO, GEO) and provides a step-by-step operational sequence. These are designed to be adapted, not followed rigidly.

## Workflow 1: From Zero to First 100 ICP Signups via SEO + AIO

### Context

You are an early-stage company (pre-Series A or bootstrapped) with a working product but no organic acquisition engine. You have limited budget and no dedicated content team. Your goal is to get your first 100 ICP-fit signups from organic search within 90 days.

### Inputs

- ICP definition (who you are targeting, what pain they have).
- Product positioning (how you solve the pain differently).
- Access to an AI writing tool (Claude, ChatGPT, or similar).
- A CMS or static site where you can publish content.
- Google Search Console and a basic analytics tool.

### Steps

1. **Define 3-5 seed topics** directly tied to your product's primary use cases. These should be problems your ICP searches for, not your product name.
2. **Use AI to expand seeds into 50-100 keywords.** Prompt: "Given that my product does [X] for [ICP], list 50 search queries someone would type when looking for a solution like this." Validate with Google Search Console or a keyword tool.
3. **Cluster keywords by intent.** Group into informational (top-of-funnel), comparison (mid-funnel), and solution-aware (bottom-of-funnel). Use Keyword Insights or manual classification.
4. **Prioritize 10 pages to write first.** Pick pages with clear buying intent and manageable keyword difficulty. Aim for a mix: 5 informational, 3 comparison, 2 product-led.
5. **Generate content briefs with AI.** For each page, prompt AI to create a brief: target keyword, secondary keywords, outline, questions to answer, and competitor content summary.
6. **Draft content with AI, edit with human judgment.** Use AI for the first draft. Spend your editing time on accuracy, voice, and adding unique product perspective that AI cannot generate.
7. **Optimize each page for on-page SEO.** Ensure title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, internal links, and schema markup are in place.
8. **Set up conversion points on every page.** Each page should have a CTA relevant to its funnel position: email capture for TOFU, free trial/demo for BOFU.
9. **Publish and submit to Google Search Console.** Request indexing for each new URL.
10. **Build 3-5 internal links between your new pages** to create a topical cluster. Link TOFU pages to your BOFU comparison and product pages.
11. **Distribute each piece via one additional channel** (LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, or email to existing contacts).
12. **Set up a simple dashboard** tracking: impressions → clicks → sessions → signups, segmented by page.
13. **After 30 days, review data and double down.** Refresh any page that has impressions but low CTR (rewrite title/description). Write more content around topics showing traction.

### Expected outputs

- 10 published, SEO-optimized pages targeting ICP-relevant queries.
- A conversion path on each page leading to signup.
- A dashboard tracking organic search → signup pipeline.
- Data to inform the next 90-day content sprint.

### Metrics to watch

- Impressions and clicks per page (Google Search Console).
- Organic sessions (analytics).
- Signup conversion rate from organic traffic.
- Time from publish to first ranking (page-level).

## Workflow 2: Upgrade Legacy Blog to AI-Optimized Revenue Engine

### Context

You have an existing blog with 50-200 posts, some organic traffic, but low conversion. Content was written without SEO strategy or funnel mapping. You want to turn this into a revenue-contributing asset without starting over.

### Inputs

- Access to existing blog content and analytics.
- Google Search Console data (at least 3 months).
- An AI writing tool and a content optimization tool (e.g., Surfer, Clearscope).
- CRM or product analytics showing conversion events.

### Steps

1. **Export Google Search Console data** for all blog URLs: queries, clicks, impressions, average position.
2. **Categorize each post** by funnel stage (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU) and by conversion potential (does this topic align with buying intent?).
3. **Identify quick wins.** Posts ranking positions 4-20 with decent impressions are candidates for optimization. These pages are already indexed and relevant; they just need improvement.
4. **Use AI to audit each quick-win post.** Prompt: "Compare this blog post to the top 3 ranking pages for [target keyword]. What topics, questions, or depth is this post missing?"
5. **Rewrite and expand the top 10 quick-win posts** using the AI audit as a brief. Add missing sections, update outdated information, improve headings, and add internal links.
6. **Score each rewritten post** using a content optimization tool. Aim for a passing grade before republishing.
7. **Add conversion CTAs to every updated post.** Map CTAs to funnel stage: email opt-in for TOFU, free trial for MOFU, demo request for BOFU.
8. **Identify and consolidate thin or duplicate content.** Use AI to identify posts that target overlapping keywords. Merge or redirect the weaker pages.
9. **Build a content hub structure.** Group related posts under pillar pages. Create or update 3-5 pillar pages that serve as topical hubs with links to cluster posts.
10. **Set up UTM tracking and conversion event tracking** so you can attribute signups and pipeline to specific blog posts.
11. **Republish updated posts with current dates** and resubmit to Google Search Console.
12. **Monitor ranking and conversion changes weekly for 60 days.** Track position changes, traffic lifts, and conversion events per post.

### Expected outputs

- 10+ refreshed, optimized blog posts with conversion paths.
- A content hub architecture linking related content.
- Elimination of thin and duplicate content.
- Baseline conversion data for content-to-revenue attribution.

### Metrics to watch

- Ranking position changes for target keywords (before vs. after).
- Organic traffic to updated posts.
- Conversion rate per post (signup, demo request, etc.).
- Reduction in content cannibalization (fewer pages competing for same queries).

## Workflow 3: GTM for New Feature Launch Powered by AI Content

### Context

Your product team is shipping a new feature. The GTM team needs to generate awareness, capture demand, and activate users around this feature. You have 2-4 weeks of lead time before launch.

### Inputs

- Product brief or PRD for the new feature.
- Internal product/feature notes and positioning guidance.
- Target audience segment for this feature.
- Access to AI tools for content generation.

### Steps

1. **Extract the core narrative from the product brief.** Use AI to summarize: what the feature does, who it is for, what problem it solves, and how it is different.
2. **Research the search landscape.** Identify whether people are already searching for this type of feature. If yes, map the keyword cluster. If no, focus on adjacent problem-aware queries.
3. **Generate a launch content plan.** At minimum, produce:
   - Product/feature landing page (SEO-optimized for the target keyword).
   - "How to" or tutorial blog post (targets informational queries).
   - Comparison or "why us" page (if competitors offer similar features).
   - Changelog or release note (for existing users).
4. **Use AI to draft all four content pieces.** Provide the AI with the product brief and extracted narrative as context. Generate first drafts for all pieces in one session.
5. **Review drafts with product and engineering.** Ensure technical accuracy and that the messaging matches the intended positioning.
6. **Optimize the landing page and blog post for SEO.** Target keywords, meta tags, schema, internal links to related content.
7. **Set up conversion tracking for the feature.** Define the activation event (e.g., "user created first [feature object]") and track it from landing page visit through activation.
8. **Build an email sequence for existing users.** Announce the feature, show how to use it, and follow up with a case study or tutorial.
9. **Create distribution assets with AI.** Generate: LinkedIn post, Twitter thread, email subject line variants, and a short demo script.
10. **Launch, monitor, and iterate.** Track: landing page traffic → feature activation → retention at 7/30 days.

### Expected outputs

- Feature landing page live and indexed.
- Blog tutorial ranking for target queries.
- Email sequence deployed to relevant user segments.
- Multi-channel distribution package (social, email, changelog).
- Tracking dashboard for feature-specific GTM metrics.

### Metrics to watch

- Landing page organic impressions and clicks (weeks 2-8 post-launch).
- Feature activation rate from organic traffic vs. other channels.
- Email open rate and click-through rate for the announcement sequence.
- 30-day retention for users who activated the new feature.

## Workflow 4: Turning Raw Product Notes into a SEO + AIO + GEO Launch Plan

### Context

You are a GTM lead or founder. You have rough product/feature notes (a Notion doc, a Slack thread, a PRD draft) and you need to turn them into a complete GTM launch plan that spans search, AI content, and growth. This workflow is specifically about the planning phase, not execution.

### Inputs

- Raw product/feature notes (any format).
- ICP definition.
- Current GTM metrics baseline.

### Steps

1. **Feed the raw notes to an AI assistant.** Prompt: "Summarize this into: (a) what the feature does, (b) who benefits, (c) what problem it solves, (d) how it differs from alternatives."
2. **Generate a keyword research brief.** Prompt: "Based on this feature summary, list 20 search queries a [ICP] might use when looking for this type of solution."
3. **Map keywords to funnel stages.** Classify each keyword as awareness, consideration, or decision. Prioritize by estimated buying intent.
4. **Define the content plan.** For each funnel stage, specify: content type (landing page, blog post, comparison page, tutorial), target keyword, and draft due date.
5. **Identify the GEO motion.** Decide: is this a self-serve activation (PLG), a sales-assist motion (demo → close), or a hybrid? This determines the conversion path and tooling.
6. **Map the activation sequence.** From first visit to first value moment: what pages do they see, what emails do they receive, what in-product experience do they get?
7. **Define measurement plan.** For each stage (Discover → Capture → Activate → Convert → Expand), specify the metric, the tool that tracks it, and the target.
8. **Draft a timeline.** Break the plan into weekly milestones across content production, technical setup, and launch activities.
9. **Review with stakeholders.** Share the plan with product, sales, and engineering. Collect feedback.
10. **Finalize and assign owners.** Each content piece, technical task, and measurement setup should have a named owner and a deadline.

### Expected outputs

- A complete GTM launch plan document.
- Content calendar with topics, keywords, and deadlines.
- Measurement plan with metrics, tools, and targets.
- A timeline with weekly milestones and owners.

### Metrics to watch

- Plan completion rate (did everything ship on time?).
- First organic impression date for launch content.
- Launch-week activation rate vs. baseline.

## Workflow 5: Quarterly SEO + AIO + GEO Performance Review

### Context

End of quarter. You need to assess the GTM engine's performance across all three pillars, identify what worked, what did not, and set priorities for the next quarter.

### Inputs

- Google Search Console data (quarterly).
- Product analytics data (signups, activation, conversion).
- CRM data (pipeline, revenue, attribution).
- Content production log (what was published, when).

### Steps

1. **Pull acquisition metrics.** Organic impressions, clicks, sessions, and new leads from search. Compare to previous quarter and to targets.
2. **Pull activation metrics.** Signups, PQL rate, and activation rate from organic traffic specifically. Compare to other channels.
3. **Pull revenue metrics.** Pipeline generated, opportunities created, and revenue closed from organic-sourced leads. Calculate organic CAC.
4. **Analyze content performance.** Rank all content published this quarter by: traffic, conversion rate, and pipeline contribution. Identify top 5 and bottom 5 performers.
5. **Review AIO efficiency.** How much content was produced? What was the AI-to-human effort ratio? What was the average time from brief to publish?
6. **Identify SEO wins and losses.** Which keywords improved in ranking? Which declined? Are there new ranking opportunities from keyword gaps?
7. **Assess GEO funnel health.** Where is the biggest drop-off in the funnel? Is the bottleneck in acquisition, activation, conversion, or retention?
8. **Generate insights with AI.** Feed the performance data into an AI assistant and prompt: "Based on this quarterly data, what are the top 3 opportunities and top 3 risks for next quarter?"
9. **Draft next-quarter priorities.** Based on the review, set 3-5 priorities with specific metrics and owners.
10. **Present to leadership.** Create a concise quarterly review deck or document.

### Expected outputs

- Quarterly performance report covering all three pillars.
- Top and bottom content performers identified.
- Funnel bottleneck analysis.
- Next-quarter priorities with metrics and owners.

### Metrics to watch

- Quarter-over-quarter growth in organic sessions, signups, and pipeline.
- Content production velocity (pieces per month).
- Organic CAC trend.
- Funnel conversion rates at each stage.
